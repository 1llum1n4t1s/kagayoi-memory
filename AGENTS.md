# Repository guidance

This repository packages the Kagayoi Memory self-hosted Cloudflare server and its Codex plugin.

- Keep `client/` compatible with Node.js 24 and avoid runtime dependencies unless they materially improve reliability.
- Keep `server/` deployable with Wrangler. Never commit API keys, generated resource IDs, `.dev.vars`, or `.wrangler/` state.
- Preserve the storage, provenance, recall, and enrichment contracts in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md), including the 1.x connection/environment readers, legacy capture receipts and spaces, existing document IDs, and persisted `sm_*` metadata.
- Keep the official Codex local memory store outside this integration.
- Changes to capture must preserve deterministic capture keys/custom IDs, retry-safe document reuse, and redaction of the configured memory API key and supported secret patterns.
- Run client tests, server tests, plugin validation, and `git diff --check` for affected changes.
- Do not deploy, migrate a remote database, publish a package, create a remote repository, push, run `scripts/setup-topics.mjs --apply` or `pnpm -C server test:live`, or invoke remote consolidation without an explicit request.

## Dependency maintenance

- Update `server/package.json` and `server/pnpm-lock.yaml` together, then verify the frozen-lockfile install and server checks below.
- Review `server/pnpm-workspace.yaml` with dependency updates. It holds native build approvals for `esbuild` and `workerd` and exact-version `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` entries; replace obsolete exceptions when upgrading rather than broadening them to all versions.
- Keep `.github/dependabot.yml` covering GitHub Actions and npm manifests in both `/` and `/server` on a weekly schedule, with minor and patch updates grouped separately from major updates.

## Validation

Run these checks from the repository root for affected changes (Node.js 24.18.0 or later in the 24 series, pnpm 11.4.0):

```powershell
node --test client/*.test.mjs scripts/*.test.mjs
node scripts/capture-redaction-e2e.mjs
node scripts/client-repair-e2e.mjs
node scripts/capture-diagnostics-e2e.mjs
node scripts/opop-client-e2e.mjs
node scripts/recall-hook-e2e.mjs
pnpm -C server install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm -C server check
node scripts/validate-plugin.mjs
pnpm run package:plugin
git diff --check
```

Server tests use local D1 and deterministic AI/vector fixtures. Provisioning tests simulate Wrangler calls without creating remote resources. In `server/tests/smoke.mjs`, preserve bounded waits for local Worker startup and MCP responses; on Windows, stop the Wrangler process tree, including `workerd`, before removing temporary D1 state so database locks are released.

`scripts/capture-redaction-e2e.mjs` exercises the real Stop hook against an authenticated loopback API and writes `dist/capture-redaction-after-validation.json`. It verifies secret assignments in captured content and titles, preserved discussion text, deterministic IDs, acknowledged retry suppression, and concurrent Stop receipt integrity. Keep its rendezvous and child-process waits bounded, including the missing-participant canary. It runs with the script checks in CI.

`scripts/client-repair-e2e.mjs` verifies Unicode-safe output with unchanged v2 capture identities and bounded history discovery. `scripts/capture-diagnostics-e2e.mjs` verifies fixed capture failure codes through the hook and standalone CLI without exposing exception text. Both use isolated fixtures, write reproducible results under `dist/`, and run with the script checks. `server/tests/review-fixes-e2e.mjs` verifies atomic source/checkpoint mutations, restore/forget cleanup races, FTS updates, and scoped consolidation queries through the authenticated Worker and migration-backed SQLite. It runs as part of `pnpm -C server check` and writes `dist/server-review-fixes-validation.json`.

`scripts/opop-client-e2e.mjs` checks invalid configuration and stdin roots, legacy settings fallback, partial document-fetch notifications, and event-specific hook imports through actual launcher processes and an authenticated loopback API. Inspect the checks and module-load counts in `dist/opop-client-validation.json`.

`scripts/recall-hook-e2e.mjs` verifies current recall contracts through actual hook subprocesses without depending on Git HEAD. It checks duplicate suppression, revisions, compaction, bounded context, and Git discovery counts, writes `dist/recall-hook-validation.json`, and runs with the script checks. Use `--runtime-root dist/kagayoi-memory` to check the packaged launcher; both subprocess waits and fixture cleanup must remain bounded and portable.

When changing asynchronous enrichment, preserve revision guards and project-scoped fact relationships; validate stale topic/vector work and update/forget races in `server/tests/races.test.mjs`, plus the API coverage in `server/tests/smoke.mjs`. Vector changes must also cover bounded Vectorize lookups, forgotten-vector cleanup even when AI enrichment is disabled, and repair after late upserts or deletion races. Topic API changes must retain unclassified browsing and exact-topic filtering across legacy and shared spaces.

For recall changes, validate the [recall contracts](DESIGN.md#recall) through `server/tests/recall-efficiency.mjs`, which connects the real client and authenticated Worker API to migration-backed SQLite with deterministic AI/vector fixtures. Retain coverage for request/embedding/vector counts across many spaces, scoped searches, failure fallback, legacy indexes, source excerpts, and checkpoint selection. Inspect its reproducible metrics and results in `dist/recall-efficiency-validation.json`.

`server/tests/opop-performance.mjs` compares current and former display projections and ranking through authenticated Worker APIs on migration-backed SQLite. It verifies identical public JSON, stable ties, checkpoint selection, scopes, and retained semantic embeddings, and measures actual D1 row bytes and bounded ranking computation. It runs with server checks and writes `dist/opop-performance-validation.json`; its synthetic CPU timings do not measure deployed API latency.

Consolidation changes must preserve the [project consolidation contracts](DESIGN.md#project-consolidation). Cover them in `client/mcp-server.test.mjs`, `server/tests/races.test.mjs`, and the authenticated API path in `server/tests/smoke.mjs`. Validate truncated-output retry, publication races, stale checkpoint recovery, and enrichment/scheduled failure diagnostics in `server/tests/log-regressions.mjs`; inspect `dist/server-log-validation.json`. Both artifact-producing checks run as part of `pnpm -C server check`. Preserve both cron definitions in `server/wrangler.example.jsonc`, and apply migration `0005_memory_consolidations.sql` before installing a client that depends on consolidation.

`pnpm run package:plugin` builds and validates `dist/kagayoi-memory`. CI runs the client, script, server, and plugin checks and uploads the package as an artifact; `git diff --check` remains a local check. Release tagging and publication are separate operations.
