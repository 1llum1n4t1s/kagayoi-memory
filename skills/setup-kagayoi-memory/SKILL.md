# Setup Kagayoi Memory

Paths below are relative to the installed plugin root, two directories above this file. Resolve them to absolute paths before running commands; the current task folder does not necessarily contain the plugin's scripts or server.

Determine whether the user is connecting to an existing server or creating resources in their own Cloudflare account.

For an existing server, obtain the HTTPS base URL without secrets in chat. Run `scripts/setup-client.ps1`; accept the API key through its secure prompt or the process-scoped `KAGAYOI_MEMORY_API_KEY` environment variable. `KAGAYOI_MEMORY_API_URL` can provide the endpoint. Use `-Force` when intentionally updating an existing connection; preserve its other settings. Verify `/v3/session`, then run the MCP `whoAmI` tool and report the discovered topic-search scope without printing credentials.

For a new server, install the pinned dependencies with `pnpm -C server install --frozen-lockfile`, authenticate Wrangler, and run `node scripts/setup-server.mjs` for read-only discovery. When deployment is authorized, supply the chosen key through `KAGAYOI_MEMORY_API_KEY` and run the same command with `--apply`. Consult `--help` for resource names and location. The script creates or reuses D1 and Vectorize, writes ignored local configuration, applies migrations, deploys, and verifies the endpoint. Reuse the configuration for updates. A request to prepare files locally does not authorize provisioning or deployment.

Install or update `kagayoi-memory` using Codex's plugin-creator workflow and its personal marketplace. Do not duplicate its hooks in user hooks or register a second copy of its MCP server. Codex requires user review and trust of current plugin hook definitions; installing alone is insufficient. After installation or update, use a new task to load the skills and MCP tools. Preserve the existing connection file and v2 capture receipts when replacing an older manual integration.

For a 1.x installation, let `scripts/setup-client.ps1` read the former `supermemory.json` file and legacy environment variables, then write the normal `~/.codex/kagayoi-memory.json` configuration. Do not rename or rewrite existing document IDs, physical spaces, deterministic capture IDs, or persisted `sm_*` metadata; those identifiers are compatibility contracts rather than current product branding. Kagayoi Memory is independent of hosted Supermemory.

Keep each installation isolated by endpoint and key. Save new records to the shared `memories` collection and preserve the derived project tag in `metadata.sm_project_id` as provenance. Existing folder spaces remain readable through global topic recall and browsing. Retrieve records through this integration's API; Codex's built-in local memory files remain outside this workflow.

For manual saves, use the current task's absolute `sourceFolder` or a single valid MCP workspace root when available to attach provenance. If the workspace is unavailable, save to the common collection without inventing a source folder. An explicit `containerTag` overrides storage. Browse with `listTopics` and `listDocuments` or `listMemories` using an optional `topic`; the default list spans all spaces. Use `topic: "__unclassified__"` for records awaiting classification, and `listSpaces` for physical storage diagnostics. `whoAmI` can report an unavailable workspace while API authentication and global discovery remain connected.

When updating to topic browsing, apply the server migrations and deploy the compatible backend within the user's authorization before updating the client. Existing records retain their IDs and physical spaces. Preview old-record classification with `node scripts/setup-topics.mjs --limit 10`; when remote enrichment is authorized, add `--apply` to queue that finite batch. The script reports accepted jobs rather than completion. Verify classification through `getDocument` and `listTopics` before another batch. Classification uses the existing Workers AI enrichment call and billing; with enrichment disabled, records remain in the unclassified list.

For code changes, run the client tests, `pnpm -C server test`, the plugin validator, and the skill validator. Treat a 100-space discovery result as incomplete because the current API caps that listing.
